Learning Python
To create a file in IDLE, go to File > New window (Shortcut: Ctrl+N)
Write Python code & save with.py file extension.
Go to Run> Run module (Shortcut:f5) & can see the output.
text editors:- Notepad++, Visual Studio

x=2 Assignment Statement
x=x+2 Assignment with expression
print(x) Print statement
Variable Operator Constant Reserved Word 

Interactive Python is good for experiments and programs of 3-4 lines
Program Steps or Program Flow
Like a Recipe or installation instructions, a program is a sequence of steps to be done in order.
Some steps are Conditional - they may be skipped.
Sometimes a step or group of steps is to be Repeated.
Sometimes we store a set of steps to be used over and over as needed several places throughout the program

Sequential Steps
When a program is running,it flows from one step to the next. As programmers, we set up "paths" for the program to follow.
x=2
print(x)
x=x+2
print(x)
output : 2 4
Conditional Steps
Repeated Steps
Loops(repeated steps) have iteration variables that change each time through a loop.

Sequential,Repeated,Conditional
name=input('Enter file:')
handle=open(name, 'r')
counts=dict()
to ask for a file name & opens the file.
it creates a data structure called a dictionary.
this is all sequential
now the for is another form of loops,so this is going for a while.
This is within a loop,we can even have two indents.
That's another loop,so these are like repeated,and then it goes down to the next sequential bit.Then it does this
Here's another loop that's going to run.Then here's a conditional that's going to run.
When it's all done,we print out the last thing.
This is of course the program that does,it figures out the most common word and prints that most common word out.
So this is python short story.
It reads some data,it reads the name of a file,it opens that file,it talks about how to make a histogram,and then it looks through for the most common word.  

Chapter 2 :- Variables,Expressions, and Statements
Constants
* Fixed Values such as numbers,letters, and strings, are called "Constants" because their value does not change
* Numeric Constants are as you expect
String Constants use single quote(') or double quote (")
eg:>>> print (123)
output is 123
>>> print(98.6)
output is 98.6

Variables
* A Variable is a named place in the memory where a programmer can store data and later retrieve the data using the Variable "name"
* Programmers get to choose the names of the variables
* You can change the contents of a variable in a later statement
x=12.2    o/p: x 12.2
y=14      o/p: y 14
the assignment statement as having an arrow to it so this is not saying X for all time is the same as 12.2 wt it's saying is take 12 point to find a place find some memory in your computer there master python give it a label X we get to choose the X that's the variable part we choose it right and then stick 12 in it and then the same is true for 14 we will find in there another spot name it y and then put a 14 in there so think of this as an arrow every time you see that equality the assignment in an assignment statement now these variables hold one value so now if we have these three statements these two and then   
x=12.2     o/p: x 100 
y=14       o/p: y 14
x=100
