Program Steps or Program Flow
Like a Recipe or installation instructions, a program is a sequence of steps to be done in order.
Some steps are Conditional - they may be skipped.
Sometimes a step or group of steps is to be Repeated.
Sometimes we store a set of steps to be used over and over as needed several places throughout the program

Sequential Steps
When a program is running,it flows from one step to the next. As programmers, we set up "paths" for the program to follow.
x=2
print(x)
x=x+2
print(x)
output : 2 4
Conditional Steps
Repeated Steps
Loops(repeated steps) have iteration variables that change each time through a loop.
