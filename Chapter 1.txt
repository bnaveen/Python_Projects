Chapter 1 :- Elements of Python

x=2 Assignment Statement
x=x+2 Assignment with expression
print(x) Print statement
Variable Operator Constant Reserved Word 

Interactive Python is good for experiments and programs of 3-4 lines
Program Steps or Program Flow
Like a Recipe or installation instructions, a program is a sequence of steps to be done in order.
Some steps are Conditional - they may be skipped.
Sometimes a step or group of steps is to be Repeated.
Sometimes we store a set of steps to be used over and over as needed several places throughout the program

Sequential Steps
When a program is running,it flows from one step to the next. As programmers, we set up "paths" for the program to follow.
x=2
print(x)
x=x+2
print(x)
output : 2 4
Conditional Steps
Repeated Steps
Loops(repeated steps) have iteration variables that change each time through a loop.

Sequential,Repeated,Conditional
name=input('Enter file:')
handle=open(name, 'r')
counts=dict()
to ask for a file name & opens the file.
it creates a data structure called a dictionary.
this is all sequential
now the for is another form of loops,so this is going for a while.
This is within a loop,we can even have two indents.
That's another loop,so these are like repeated,and then it goes down to the next sequential bit.Then it does this
Here's another loop that's going to run.Then here's a conditional that's going to run.
When it's all done,we print out the last thing.
This is of course the program that does,it figures out the most common word and prints that most common word out.
So this is python short story.
It reads some data,it reads the name of a file,it opens that file,it talks about how to make a histogram,and then it looks through for the most common word.
