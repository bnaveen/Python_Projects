 Chapter 2 :- Variables,Expressions, and Statements
Constants
* Fixed Values such as numbers,letters, and strings, are called "Constants" because their value does not change
* Numeric Constants are as you expect
* String Constants use single quote(') or double quote (")
eg:>>> print (123)
output is 123
>>> print(98.6)
output is 98.6

Variables
* A Variable is a named place in the memory where a programmer can store data and later retrieve the data using the Variable "name"
* Programmers get to choose the names of the variables
* You can change the contents of a variable in a later statement
x=12.2    o/p: x 12.2
y=14      o/p: y 14
the assignment statement as having an arrow to it so this is not saying X for all time is the same as 12.2 wt it's saying is take 12 point to find a place find some memory in your computer there master python give it a label X we get to choose the X that's the variable part we choose it right and then stick 12 in it and then the same is true for 14 we will find in there another spot name it y and then put a 14 in there so think of this as an arrow every time you see that equality the assignment in an assignment statement now these variables hold one value so now if we have these three statements these two and then the third one executes it says put 100 into x bt that wipes out the old value of twelve point two and it rewrite it with a hunt with a hundred and so we can change the variables that's another reason that we call them variable     
x=12.2     o/p: x 100 
y=14       o/p: y 14
x=100

Python Variable Name Rules
* Must start with a letter or underscore _
* Must consist of letters,numbers, and underscores
* Case Sensitive
 Good:  spam   eggs  spam23    _speed
 Bad:   23spam   #sign  var.12
 Different: spam   spam   SPAM
There are some names now some rules for making variable names you can start with a letter or an underscore we tend not to as normal programmers use underscore we tend to reserve those four variables that we use to communicae with python itself so we're making up a variable we tend not to use underscore as a pre first character you can have letters and numbers and underscores after the first character and their case sensitive it is really a bad idea to use causes the only differentiator so in this case spam eggs spam23 and underscore meter alt or legit we would probably not use this one unless we were actually doing it because python told us to use that variable23 spam starts with the number pound sign starts and dot is not a legitimate variable character and spam capital spam and all cat spam are different but this is not something that you want to sort of  depend on too much so that's just the rule names we tend to start them with a letter and then use letters numbers and underscores               
underscores other than the first character are generally pretty common and you'll see those used a lot

Mnemonic Variable Names
Since we programmers are given a choice in how we choose our variable names, there is a bit of "best practice"
We name variables to help us remember what we intend to store in them("mnemonic"="memory aid")
This can confuse beginning students because well-named variables often "sound" so good that they must be keywords
We're choosing variable names one of the things about variables we get to choose the name we get to choose the name X choose the name Y and so sometimes we like them short but sometimes we want them descriptive and the notion that of making variables descriptive is often confusing to beginning students sometimes it's really helpful to if you're gonna have a line of text and you main the variable line that's great because the next person reading your program says that must be the line of text where is it also can't become misleading that line the name of a variable somehow has meaning so sometimes we'll having seen variables & plural variables like friend and friends like his is plural does python know about singular and plural & the answer is no so sometimes we pick variables that make no sense sometimes we pick variables that make a lot of sense this is just something that you as a beginning programmer are going to have to understand that we can pick anything we want & you'll see i'll try to call attention this in the first few lectures as we go through so 
here's a bit of code with an assignment statement - assignment statements of multiplication & a print statement & you can say what is this doing now python is perfectly happy with this code because it assigns it in there you have said please go give this as a label & then we assign two variables &  then we're carefully pulling these two variables back out multiplying them together & sticking them into yet another variable & then printing that variable out that seems like you know we can figure out what it is you just have to look really careful & a single character mistake & python is going to be you know pretty unhappy okay so that's one way to write this program.                           
	x1q3z9ocd = 35.0
	x1q3z9afd = 12.50
	x1q3p9afd = x1q3z9ocd + x1q3z9afd
	print(x1q3p9afd)
