 Chapter 2 :- Variables,Expressions, and Statements
Constants
* Fixed Values such as numbers,letters, and strings, are called "Constants" because their value does not change
* Numeric Constants are as you expect
String Constants use single quote(') or double quote (")
eg:>>> print (123)
output is 123
>>> print(98.6)
output is 98.6

Variables
* A Variable is a named place in the memory where a programmer can store data and later retrieve the data using the Variable "name"
* Programmers get to choose the names of the variables
* You can change the contents of a variable in a later statement
x=12.2    o/p: x 12.2
y=14      o/p: y 14
the assignment statement as having an arrow to it so this is not saying X for all time is the same as 12.2 wt it's saying is take 12 point to find a place find some memory in your computer there master python give it a label X we get to choose the X that's the variable part we choose it right and then stick 12 in it and then the same is true for 14 we will find in there another spot name it y and then put a 14 in there so think of this as an arrow every time you see that equality the assignment in an assignment statement now these variables hold one value so now if we have these three statements these two and then the third one executes it says put 100 into x bt that wipes out the old value of twelve point two and it rewrite it with a hunt with a hundred and so we can change the variables that's another reason that we call them variable     
x=12.2     o/p: x 100 
y=14       o/p: y 14
x=100

Python Variable Name Rules
* Must start with a letter or underscore _
* Must consist of letters,numbers, and underscores
* Case Sensitive
 Good:  spam   eggs  spam23    _speed
 Bad:   23spam   #sign  var.12
 Different: spam   spam   SPAM
There are some names now some rules for making variable names you can start with a letter or an underscore we tend not to as normal programmers use underscore we tend to reserve those four variables that we use to communicae with python itself so we're making up a variable we tend not to use underscore as a pre first character you can have letters and numbers and underscores after the first character and their case sensitive it is really a bad idea to use causes the only differentiator so in this case spam eggs spam23 and underscore meter alt or legit we would probably not use this one unless we were actually doing it because python told us to use that variable23 spam starts with the number pound sign starts and dot is not a legitimate variable character and spam capital spam and all cat spam are different but this is not something that you want to sort of  depend on too much so that's just the rule names we tend to start them with a letter and then use letters numbers and underscores               
underscores other than the first character are generally pretty common and you'll see those used a lot

Chapter 2 Expressions B
Numeric Expressions
Operator     Operation
 +           Addition
 -           Subtraction
 *           Multiplication
 /           Division
 **          Power
 %           Remainder

Order of Evaluation
When we string operators together- Python must know which one to do first
This is called "Operator precedence"
Which operator "takes precedence" over the others?
x = 1 + 2 * 3 - 4 / 5 ** 6

Operator Precedence Rules
Highest Precedence rule to lowest precedence rule:
* Parentheses are always respected                    Parenthesis
* Exponentiation (raise to a power)                     Power
* Multiplication, Division, and Remainder              Multiplication
* Addition and Subtraction                              Addition
* Left to right                                         Left to Right

>>> x = 1 + 2 ** 3 / 4 * 5  Parenthesis                               1 + 2 ** 3 / 4 * 5
>>> print(x)                  Power                                    1 + 8 / 4 * 5
                            Multiplication                              1 + 2 * 5
							Addition							         1 + 10
							Left to Right							       11
o/p: 11.0

Operator Precedence
 Remember the rules top to bottom
 When writing code - use parentheses
 When writing code - keep mathematical expression simple enough that they are easy to understand
 Break long series of mathematical operations up to make them more clear

What does " Type" Mean?
In Python variables,literals, and constants have a "type"
Python knows the difference between an integer number and a string
For example "+" means "addition" if something is a number and "concatenate" if something is a string 
                                                               concatenate = put together
Type Matters
Python knows what "type" everything is
Some operations are prohibited
You cannot "add 1" to a string
We can ask Python what type something is by using the type() function
 	
Several Types of Numbers
Numbers have two main types
Integers are whole numbers:
-14,-2,0,1,100,401233
Floating Point Numbers have decimal parts: -2.5,0.0,98.6,14.0
There are other number types- they are variations on float and integer
	
Type Conversions
When you put an integer and floating point in an expression,the integer is implicitly converted to a float
You can control this with the built-in functions int() and float()

Remainder *** TYPES PROGRAM HAS OCCURED ERROR SO IT TAKES TIME AND NOT EXECUTED AND NOT COMMITED.

Integer Division
Integer division produces a floating point result
This was different in Python 2.x
 That means Python 3's division is more predictable it works more like a calculator.
 
 String Conversions
 
 
 
 
 User Input
We can instruct Python to pause and read data from the user using the input() function
The input() function returns a string
Another thing we can do with variable just like the print function takes something. a list of things in this case a string comma a variable ('Welcome', nam) and then prints some output in the program. the opposite that is input actually input generally happens before output.
Input is built-in function & we pass to it a prompt. A string of text that's going to be printed out for the user and then it stops and waits.So it says, who are you? and then right here it just sits.waiting for us to type something.so we type kranthi and then hit the enter key and then this text ends up in this variable.
So this is an assignment statement that kranthi is the result of the input call, gets copied into the nam variable.
it's evaluating an assignment statement. input('who are you?')
