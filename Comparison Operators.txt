   Comparison Operators	
Boolean expressions ask a question and produce a Yes or No result which we use to control program flow
Boolean expressions using comparison operators evaluate to True / False or Yes / No
Comparison operators look at variables but do not change the variables
	Python      Meaning
	<           Less than
	<=          Less than or Equal to 
	==          Equal to
	>=          Greater than or Equal to
	>           Greater than
	!=          Not equal
	Remember: "=" is used for assignment.
  Indentation
Increase indent indent after an if statement or for statement (after :)
Maintain indent to indicate the scope of the block (which lines are affected by the if/for)
Reduce indent back to the level of the if statement or for statement to indicate the end of the block
Blank lines are ignored - they do not affect indentation 
Comments on a line by themselves are ignored with regard to identation
