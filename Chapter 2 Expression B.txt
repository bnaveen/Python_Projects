Operator     Operation

Order of Evaluation
When we string operators together- Python must know which one to do first
This is called "Operator precedence"
Which operator "takes precedence" over the others?
x = 1 + 2 * 3 - 4 / 5 ** 6

Operator Precedence Rules
Highest Precedence rule to lowest precedence rule:
* Parentheses are always respected                    Parenthesis
* Exponentiation (raise to a power)                     Power
* Multiplication, Division, and Remainder              Multiplication
* Addition and Subtraction                              Addition
* Left to right                                         Left to Right

>>> x = 1 + 2 ** 3 / 4 * 5  Parenthesis                               1 + 2 ** 3 / 4 * 5
>>> print(x)                  Power                                    1 + 8 / 4 * 5
                            Multiplication                              1 + 2 * 5
							Addition							         1 + 10
							Left to Right							       11
o/p: 11.0

Operator Precedence
 Remember the rules top to bottom
 When writing code - use parentheses
 When writing code - keep mathematical expression simple enough that they are easy to understand
 Break long series of mathematical operations up to make them more clear

What does " Type" Mean?
In Python variables,literals, and constants have a "type"
Python knows the difference between an integer number and a string
For example "+" means "addition" if something is a number and "concatenate" if something is a string 
                                                               concatenate = put together
Type Matters
Python knows what "type" everything is
Some operations are prohibited
You cannot "add 1" to a string
We can ask Python what type something is by using the type() function
 	
Several Types of Numbers
Numbers have two main types
Integers are whole numbers:
-14,-2,0,1,100,401233
Floating Point Numbers have decimal parts: -2.5,0.0,98.6,14.0
There are other number types- they are variations on float and integer
	
Type Conversions
When you put an integer and floating point in an expression,the integer is implicitly converted to a float
You can control this with the built-in functions int() and float()

Remainder *** TYPES PROGRAM HAS OCCURED ERROR SO IT TAKES TIME AND NOT EXECUTED AND NOT COMMITED.

Integer Division
Integer division produces a floating point result
This was different in Python 2.x
 That means Python 3's division is more predictable it works more like a calculator.
 
 String Conversions
 
 
 
 
 User Input
We can instruct Python to pause and read data from the user using the input() function
The input() function returns a string
Another thing we can do with variable just like the print function takes something. a list of things in this case a string comma a variable ('Welcome', nam) and then prints some output in the program. the opposite that is input actually input generally happens before output.
Input is built-in function & we pass to it a prompt. A string of text that's going to be printed out for the user and then it stops and waits.So it says, who are you? and then right here it just sits.waiting for us to type something.so we type kranthi and then hit the enter key and then this text ends up in this variable.
So this is an assignment statement that kranthi is the result of the input call, gets copied into the nam variable.
it's evaluating an assignment statement. input('who are you?')
		
Converting User Input
If we want to read a number from the user, we must convert it from a string to a number using a type conversion function
Later we will deal with bad input data
So here's we have to read the floor that we are at in Europe, and then we're going to convert it to a US floor,and then we're gonna print it out. This is very silly but it is a pure essential program that has input,	does some kind of task on that input, and then produces some output which is useful,for some value of useful.so let's take a look at how we combine everything that we've learned in this lecturer input,processing, and output.
It's a three line program,but it's sort of the beginning of something that programs do.
Comments in Python
Anything after a # is ignored by python
Comment is a way for you to put in a program file some text that's to be ignored by python or C.Whatever language we happens to be using.
In python comments start with a pound sign. So what you could do is put a pound sign anywhere in a line, and then after the pound sign Python ignores everything after that pound sign it can be the first character.
Why comment?
 Describe what is going to happen in a sequence of code
 Document who wrote the code or other ancillary information
 Turn off a line of code-perhaps temporarily
Another element of most any programming language is what's called a comment.
